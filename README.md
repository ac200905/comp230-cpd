# Weekly Reports

## Week 1
Started the week off doing my world pitch which I found incredibly nerve-racking. I think it went ok though, my idea was a game in the style of a cave painting on the wall of a cave. I doubt we’ll be using it in the group project however.

Week 2
Started working on prototypes for the group game. We started with mechanics we’d like the game to have. I came up with the idea of teleportation as a mechanic and so I’m the programmer for that prototype. Started the interface task research journal this week.

## Week 3
I have chosen to make a night time forest scene for my comp220 porfolio. I really like games like The Long Dark and Firewatch  so I think the atmospheric lighting and cel shaded style would be interesting to learn. My prototype for the group project is going well, I think it’s going to be a first person speedrunning game. I’ve not had much input from the designer on my team so I’m basically making the prototype by myself. I get the feeling the designer I’m paired with isn’t very interested in being a designer.

## Week 4
My prototype was chosen as the one we’re going to go forward with which is good. I think it’s because I made it purposefully simple and small scope, that and people playtesting it seem to enjoy playing because it’s competitive. Been learning to load models into my 220 portfolio, I’m finding Brian’s video’s very useful as I sometimes fall a bit behind during the live coding sessions.

## Week 5
Sam’s working a lot on the group project which is great. I’ve managed to implement most of the basic things that were in my prototype. I haven’t really been talking in the ethics and professionalism dialogues, I just don’t want to look like I have no idea what I’m talking about I guess. Found

## Week 6
I’ve been adding quite a bit to the player abilities in the group project, including adding a slow motion effect to the teleport. I found the viva for the interface task a bit anxiety inducing, I’m not very good at explaining my work.

## Week 7
Started working on a ledge detection system which is quite tricky. Once again got very nervous about doing my essay presentation, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be though and I got some helpful feedback out of it. Started working on my VR game, I’ve decided to make a teleporting system since it ties in from what I’m doing in our group project. I’ve been learning about lighting in 220 which is one of the key aspects of my portfolio. It seems complicated but I think I can implement it into my code.

## Week 8
After doing some research I found out that my VR game idea is basically already a mechanic in a game called Budget cuts so I’ve added a twist in the form of adding the ability to switch between two different realities as well teleportation. Finished my ethics essay, it wasn’t great, I always find it difficult to focus on a small section of a topic, especially when I don’t know much about the topic in a broader sense to begin with. 

## Week 9
The group game is coming along. It looks much better with art assets being added but I feel like the gameplay is lacking something and the level designs so far are very basic.

## Week 10
The group game is coming along, although there isn’t a lot of synergy between the designers and programmers I feel. It’s difficult to all agree on a direction for the mechanics. I might have to just experiment with different changed and see if they work during playtesting.

## Week 11
VR game is finished. I’m happy with the demo I’ve made, I’m quite lucky to have a Vive at home, it’s made test a lot faster and easier. Most of the team has been quite busy with deadlines so not a lot of work has been done on the group game. 

## Week 12
Spent most of the week polishing my project. I’ve had a bit of trouble with my 220 portfolio and have left it a bit late to fix. I couldn’t get my shader class to work in an earlier version and so left it to move on with the next lecture topics but now I’m going to have to spend more time over Christmas trying to refactor it into my latest version. I think my time management hasn’t been particularly great this semester and has led to a lot of stressful situations so that’s something I’ll need to mention in my cpd.
